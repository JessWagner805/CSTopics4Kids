## Maze Problem üß©

Before diving into the idea of *quantum computing*, think about how you would solve this maze.

![MazeNoSolution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a648135-2455-4c10-835f-4e88c5b4ee76)

For most people, you would try one path, fail, go back, and then try again.

and again...

and again......

![MazeNoSolution2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a48e81c1-e7a2-40d5-9c96-ddf6915b697c)

Until eventually, you have found a solution. <br/>
Although this strategy works, it takes a lot of time because you can only try *one* path at a time.

‚≠ê But imagine if, instead of trying one path at a time, you could try *every* path *all at once*? ‚≠ê

Regular computers solve problems similar to how we did with the maze. They are given instructions by a programmer, and they follow these instructions step-by-step until they reach a solution. <br/>
Quantum computers, on the other hand, can perform every step at the same time, reaching a solution much faster!

## What exactly is quantum computing? üñ•Ô∏è

Unlike regular computers that preform tasks step-by-step, quantum computers can preform multiple tasks at the same time. This makes them *incredibly fast*. <br/>
Because of this, quantum computers can solve problems that regular computers can‚Äôt, opening up new possibilities for fields like medicine, science, and technology. <br/>
Though some quantum computers exist, they‚Äôre still in the early stages of development. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM are working hard to advance this technology.

## How does it work? ü§î

What makes quantum computers special is something called ***qubits***. To understand qubits, let's first understand bits. <br/>
The word ***bit*** is short for *binary digit*. As the name suggests, a bit consists of two digits: 0 and 1. The digit **0** means **off**, and **1** means **on**. Think of a light switch: when the switch is up, it's a 1, and when it's down, it's a 0. <br/> 
When a programmer writes code, it gets converted to a series of 1s and 0s. The computer reads these bits and uses them to perform an action.

While a bit is either a 1 or a 0, a ***qubit*** can be *both* a 1 and a 0 at the same time! This special ability, called ***superposition***, allows qubits to perform many actions at once, instead of doing things step by step like regular bits. These qubits are made up of tiny particles like electrons, photons, and trapped ions. These particles give qubits their ability to be two things at once.

## How can a qubit be *both* a 1 AND a 0 *at the same time?* ü§Ø

The idea of a qubit being both a 1 AND a 0 at the same time might seem confusing, so let's take a deeper look. <br/>   

**TO DO**

## Pros & Cons ‚ú®

**PROS ‚úÖ**
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ***Speed:*** Quantum computers perform tasks A LOT faster than regular computers.
- üîê ***Cracking Codes:*** Quantum computers could crack many codes that are currently used to keep data hidden.
- üõ°Ô∏è ***Security:*** Quantum computers could create even stronger codes that are much harder for hackers to break.
- üî¨ ***New Discoveries:*** Quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in medicine, mathematics, engineering, and more.

**CONS ‚ùå**
- ***üí≤Cost:*** Building and maintaining quantum computers is very expensive because they require special materials and highly skilled workers.
- ***‚ö°Electricity:*** Quantum computers use a lot of energy, making them bad for the environment. This is because energy is often produced by burning fossil fuels, a process which releases harmful gases into the atmosphere.
- ***‚ö†Ô∏è Sensitivity:*** Quantum computers are very sensitive to environmental disturbances such as noise. This increases the risk of mistakes.
- ***üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Errors:*** Mistakes are hard to find and fix with quantum computers due to their size and complexity.
