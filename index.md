## Maze Problem üß©

Before diving into the idea of *quantum computing*, think about how you would solve this maze.

For most people, you would try one path, fail, go back, and then try again.

and again...

and again......

Until eventually, you have found a solution. <br/>
Although this strategy worked, it took a lot of time because you could only try *one* path at a time.

Regular computers solve problems like we did with the maze. They are given instructions by a programmer, and they follow these instructions step-by-step until they reach a solution. <br/>
Quantum computers, on the other hand, can perform every step at the same time, reaching a solution much faster!
